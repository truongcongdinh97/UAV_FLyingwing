I understand you want to apply the edit "Final working version - no comments in filepath" to the camera test file, but I'm unable to see the actual code changes you'd like to make.

The text you provided appears to be a description or comment about what the edit should accomplish (removing comments from file paths), but I need to see:

1. **The specific code modifications** - what lines should be added, changed, or deleted?
2. **Or the complete updated code** for the camera test file

Could you please provide either:
- The actual code changes you want to apply
- Or the full content of the updated camera test file

Once you share the specific code modifications, I'll be happy to help apply them to create the final working version without comments in the file paths.
